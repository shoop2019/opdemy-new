If the MTU size is too small on your machine, then the connection will spend more time on sending headers than the actual data.  However, when trying to connect from an computer hooked up to the internet by an ISP that uses PPPoE, I cannot establish a tunnel between the two computers, as the MTU size for PPPoE is set to 1492 and the server expects 1500, so packages of 1500 bytes cannot travel over the PPPoE link restricted to 1492 bytes.  MSS is generally MTU - 40, where MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) is the largest packet size that can be transmitted.  1500: The biggest-sized IP packet that can normally traverse the Internet without getting fragmented.  When a packet is sent from a local host to a host in a remote network, the frame may traverse multiple router hops.  This overhead isn&#39;t a big deal but sometimes ISPs or remote Internet sites do stupid things to break PPPoE or non-1500 byte MTU connected machines.  The important commands being &quot;mtu 1508&quot; under the Ethernet0 interface and &quot;pppoe-client ppp-max-payload 1500&quot; under the sub-interface. net) no longer&nbsp; I know that RFC2516 (PPPoE) limits the MTU to 1492 bytes; however when PPPoE is not used this limit should not exist.  I&#39;d guess that PMTUD is&nbsp; This is the best command to help you determine the best MTU size for your network.  MTUs can be measured either at the network layer or at the link If you have tracepath from the Linux iputils, run tracepath 8.  The tunnel has an overhead of 20 bytes for the IPv4 header meaning the maximum MTU of the tunnel can be is 1480 for a connection with an MTU of The maximum MTU you can expect that all network nodes will allow is 1500, so calculate whatever additional overhead there is and subtract that from 1500.  The normal MTU (Maximum Transmit Unit) value for most Ethernet networks is 1500 Bytes, or 1492 Bytes for PPPoE connections.  An Ethernet and PPPoE frame contains one of these Ethertypes: 0x8863 Ethertype = PPPoE control packets 0x8864 Ethertype = PPPoE data packets IP MTU: Click the Advanced tab, and In the IP MTU field, ensure that the IP MTU is at least 8 bytes less than the MTU on the physical interface.

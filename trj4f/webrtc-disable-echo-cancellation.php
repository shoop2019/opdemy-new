The following code demonstrates the implementation of a LocalCameraMedia class with two constructors.  The extended filter mode is disabled by default, because it seemed produce worse results during double-talk (based on some very quick testing).  SHOULD include an AEC and if not, SHOULD ensure that the speaker-to-microphone gain is below unity at all frequencies to avoid instability when none of the client has echo cancellation.

WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) is a free, open-source project that provides web browsers and mobile applications with real-time communication (RTC) via simple application programming interfaces (APIs). &quot; When this setting is turned off, the volume controls on the side of the phone no longer work for the earpiece; the earpiece becomes stuck at full volume.  Until this is fixed or updated/labelled as impossible, I have a workaround, which I still have to test properly remotely, but it involves using an audio This DSP library can be used to enhance voice signal for real time communication call.  // - Faster startup times by removing the excessive &quot;startup phase&quot; processing // of reported delays.  The value may not be significant if audio device volume is&nbsp; If the users are not smart enough to disable them (99% of them are not) they will have a very bad experience in using webrtc.  Similarly, clients SHOULD have the ability to detect the presence of a headset and disable echo cancellation.  Jun 25, 2013 · You may hear echo on calls when you or the party you’re talking to is playing sound over your computer speakers. 37 (current Beta) Echo cancellation helps cover up the problem but doesn&#39;t prevent it at it&#39;s source.

At the current moment, false value will provide a good sound quality, but will disable some additional features such as &quot;echo cancellation&quot; Check out current documentation page for updates relative to audio_processing property.  Acoustic Echo Cancellation (AEC) It is plausible that the dominant near to mid-term WebRTC usage model will be people using the interactive audio and video capabilities to communicate with each other via web browsers running on a notebook computer that has built-in microphone and speakers.  No echo, whatever microphone The only issue is that Rendezvous appear to have some audio filter (probably to reduce echo or noise) but this make the sound be like in a phaser or compressor. 1 kHz sample rate mismatches cause echo; The &quot;ambient noise reduction&quot; which can be enabled on the built-in mic on Mac appears to cause a very small amount of echo; Solutions: Ensure both capture and render devices are set to either 44.  The webrtcdsp element can be used along, or with the help of the webrtcechoprobe if echo cancellation is enabled.

At the moment we did the demo Visual Studio templates for desktop projects were under development, so I used the console.  May be as easy as Ethernet Link device depending on whether a computer near phone lines has available serial port, or USB-to-Serial Converter cable is used.  I guess &quot;Technically&quot; its actually a Virtual Serial Port on the PC side, But I hope my description is clear enough to understand.  I had the same problem with a Maxbotix sensor that was using an FTDI chip for the USB-to-serial communication.  Serial Port Over WiFi: Data communication between electronic devices is inevitable in many electronic projects and brings a lot of advantages to your project i. Net / Mono Features - Easy to use - Event driven - Hot plug - Automatically restabilish connection on error/disconnect - It overcomes the lack of *DataReceived* event in Mono 22. 5 mm, 5-pole captive screw connector (connector is shared with RS-232 control port) Jan 23, 2014 ¬∑ Reading Serial data from an Arduino using C# by iainhendry71 January 23, 2014 In this example we will use analog pin 0 to obtain a value and send it via the com port (USB) , we will read this with a C# app and display the value in a progress bar and label.  Modems faster than 9600 bps will generally automatically synchronize to the speed of the serial port.  It can connect any supporting the Serial Port Profile Bluetooth devices (like cellphone, MCU, Arduino or Raspberry Pi).  Here is how they look the first time you open them: Eltima Virtual Serial Port Driver Serial Port Terminal I have tested this code running both against a Local Machine (x86) with an arduino board plugged into a usb port and on a remote Machine (rpi3) with the arduino board plugged into it.

The general idea behind the herbert is that it&#39;s a vh4 with a less tight and more forgiving voicing.  The guitar w Feb 02, 2005 Â· THe Diezel VH4 is a veyr different amp than the Mesa &gt;Mesa&#39;s Recto has a ton of low end, tons of low mids and has a overall slow response (wont get too technical why) The Recto doesn&#39;t have more gain than the Vh4 but sounds more saturated wheras the VH4 sounds crisper.  Overall the Herbert has a more familiar, slightly looser feel than the VH4, without losing much of the Diezel signature definition and tightness.  The pedal can either be operated as a preamplifier or as a complete preamp over the effect return of an amp.

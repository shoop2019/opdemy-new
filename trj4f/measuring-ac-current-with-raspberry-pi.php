This technology uses a standard Ethernet cable to send power to a special add-on board fitted to a Raspberry Pi.  The smoke stack on ELF is the roasting chamber, and this is where Feb 16, 2015 ¬∑ Hi all, bit of an amateur looking for some advice.  If your DC bus voltage remains constant then this is just a matter of measuring your DC current in each branch and multiplying by the voltage if you want to calculate power.  Solid-state relays, much like mechanical relays, are designed to allow switching of either alternating current (AC) or direct current (DC) voltages to a load.  For this wireless networking test, an ideal environment is created: a Raspberry Pi is placed in line-of-sight of an 802.  For this purpose, relays can be used on the Raspberry Pi: The relay ‚Äúswitch‚Äù is utilized by means of a low-voltage pulse.  The ADC is an I2C based device and should be connected to the Raspberry Pi as shown in the schematics below.

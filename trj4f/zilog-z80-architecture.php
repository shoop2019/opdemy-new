The basic architecture, a modified (non-strict) Harvard architecture, is technically very different from the Zilog Z80.  | | | |Type| | | World Heritage Encyclopedia, the aggregation of the largest online encyclopedias available, and the most definitive Zilog also had 16 and 32 bit microprocessors, but neither took off - the Z80 has had a long life though.  Architecture The Z180® combines a high-performance CPU core with a variety of system and I/O resources useful in a broad range of applications: Central Processing Unit: The CPU is microcoded to provide a core that is object-code compatible with the Z80 CPU. ” In addition, he didn’t feel qualified to develop a new 16-bit microprocessor architecture from whole cloth, so he went looking for an accomplished processor architect.  From its roots as an award-winning architect in the microprocessor and microcontroller industry, Zilog has evolved its expertise beyond core silicon to include SoCs, single-board computers, application-specific software stacks and development tools that allow Z80 CPU User Manual 1 Architectural Overview Zilog’s Z80 CPU family of components are fourth-generation enhanced microprocessors with exceptional computational power.  [CHM 2007] Bernard Peuto, who had been the architect for the Z8000, was Zilog’s VP of Engineering at that time.  Octopart is the world&#39;s source for Z84C0008PEG availability, pricing, and technical specs and other electronic parts.  Despite this, the instruction set and assembly language syntax are quite similar to other Zilog processors: Load/store operations use the same LD mnemonic (no MOV or MOVEs), typifying instructions such as DJNZ, are the same Z80 Microprocessor Architecture The Z 80 is one of the most talented 8 bit microprocessors, and many microprocessor-based systems are designed around the Z80.

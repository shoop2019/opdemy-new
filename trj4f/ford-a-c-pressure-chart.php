Bottom line, R134a simply&nbsp; 23 Jul 2011 I always charge cars with the AC on recirculation with the windows open, so it&#39;s High side pressure in PSI should be about 2.  Pressure and ODA Temp Method (Manufacturer&#39;s chart, and equipped with TXV or at Fixed near design conditions) Follow manufacturers instructions If provided by the manufacturer and the system is new and or completely clean, the system can be accurately charged by measuring the suction pressure, measuring outdoor air temperature and then adding The air conditioning system in your Ford Ranger is under very high pressure, but luckily it is built with a small device that prevents catastrophe.  Read the pressure indicated by the gauge needle only when the A/C compressor is running—you&#39;ll know it&#39;s running when the clutch in the center is spinning. 0L EcoBoost ® engine and available 4WD with Terrain Management System, ™ the Explorer is prepared for the road ahead.  Weighing your rig, adjusting the tire pressure to the load/inflation tables and then checking how your weight distribution hitch changes things when it’s adjusted properly is all part of the thinking Part# W8000073 - A/C High Pressure Side Switch Description: This is a Brand New Workhorse Air Conditioning High Pressure Side Switch.  It can be used for recharging refrigerant, or to diagnose an a/c system based on pressure readings from your gauges.  monitor what they are at when your engine is at a higher RPM also, have you tried cleaning your condenser coil, you Mechanics often misdiagnose high-pressure gauge readings in a car&#39;s air-conditioning system.

How to add freon to your 2013 Ford Explorer: hook up the can of refrigerant (likely r-134a) to the low pressure port.  As an air-conditioning refrigerant in newer automobiles, the optimal running pressure for R134A is between 22 and 57 pounds per square inch.  If I let the vehicle sit idle with Max A/C on, after about 15 min the temps at the inside register slowly gets down to about 45 F.  ac pressure problems Compare the pressure readings with the&nbsp; The Too high pressure of the AC might indicate leakage or diminishing amount of coolant, both of which require immediate attention.  The following automotive A/C chart outlines the proper pressure readings for a particular temperature range.  If you are replacing a compressor or other A/C system component, it is important to replace any compressor oil that has been lost when parts are changed.  Filling in the gap between the Ford F-100 and the F-250, the F-150 was meant to replace the former as the standard F-Series truck due to stricter emissions The metering device, component #3 on this air conditioning circuit and cycle diagram, is the dividing point between the high pressure and low pressure sides of the system, And is designed to maintain a specific rate of flow of refrigerant into the low side of the system.  You should always attempt to verify the information with your vehicle manual or information provided on the underhood stick, sometimes also located on the top of the accumulator.  Start the car and take note of the idle speed, then set the idle speed up to about 1200-1500 rpm, and turn the A/C on inside and set the fan speed on high. 6:1: F3: 1930s aftermarket head Model B, 3 bolt water pump provisions Inch 7/8-18 spark You may obtain connector face views, connector pinout charts, component locator charts, wiring diagrams, and diagnostic flow charts (pertaining to the code and vehicle in question) using your source of vehicle information.

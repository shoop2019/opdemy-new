Views expressed in this Amateur/Ham Radio News summary are those of the reporters and correspondents.  I can use two separate sources, but then the program only recogn EZNEC and 4nec2 are based upon the Numerical Electromagnetics Code, or NEC, which is a popular antenna modelling system for wire and surface antennas originally written in FORTRAN in the 1970s by Gerald Burke and Andrew Poggio of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.  The diagram of the network architecture provides a full picture of the established network with detailed view of all the resources accessible.  I&#39;ve halfway figured out how to use 4NEC2 and will model the whole design before starting construction.  Return to Bell Ringers home page Updated 10/09/2019 by WA5MLF I&#39;ve installed an 80 meter dipole fed with around fifty feet of ladder line to a DX-Engineering current balun and SG230 tuner.  It looks quite different to the expected behavior of the underlying loop, but it does contain an arc albeit rotated and offset.  4NEC2 calculates and displays a parallel equivalent circuit in terms of Rp and dielectric may self heal, an arc may cause damage to the metal surface which&nbsp; simulation with 4nec2 software, there is a tendency in extending the wires.  The file must not contain a mixture of LD4 cards (type R±jX loads) and LD0/1 cards (series or parallel RLC loads), although any combination of LD0 and LD1 is allowed.  It provides rich and deep antenna modeling and optimization functionality above and beyond what&#39;s available in other popular programs.  In January, 1998, the ARRL Board of Directors changed the ARRL advertisement-acceptance policy to permit the advertising of antenna gain figures for antennas whose performance can be accurately modeled using either NEC-4 or Yagi Optimizer modeling programs.

But when I tried to do an arc tangent computation, I get a &quot;Parser: Constant &#39;arctan&#39; not found.  They comprise a non-message network to meet regularly on the air to provide an exchange of communications and continuing fellowship within our area.  Most traditional antenna optimisers use a hill climbing approach to optimise your specified variables (eg element lengths) against your chosen criteria (eg Gain, F/R, SWR).  To the receiving array, it might appear that a single arc on an insulator a mile away is actually radiating from multiple directions with many phase relationships.

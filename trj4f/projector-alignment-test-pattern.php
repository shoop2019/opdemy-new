The process is simple: Test patterns are projected onto the projection surface, digital camera(s) capture these test patterns and feed them back to the system where they are analyzed.  A wide range of optical projectors are available, compatible with the test requirements for all standard cameras and laser range finders: The accurate alignment including the targets positioning at the focus is demonstrated through the supply of an individual alignment certificate showing the wavefront map.  Additionally, there are a number of test images that can help you to judge the image quality of a monitor.  Moreover, rather than simply allowing movement of the colors in single pixel increments (as in the JVC DLA-HD1/RS1 LCoS projectors) Sony&#39;s Panel Alignment offers continuous movement down to fractions of a pixel.  If you are evaluating all of the displays simultaneously, another scheme is to rate each display according to its pecking order in image quality for each test pattern, with number 1 the best.  Again, there was no colour shift on any of the test patterns, nor any visible fringes around white-on-black objects.  I was curious how folks approach deploying projectors for things like half-time shows, or outdoor events where they typically have 15-20 minutes tops to dial in alignment.

The present invention relates to projection systems, more particularly to a method for visualising test pattern grids in such a projection system.  video wall, for example, the geometric alignment and pho-tometric blending of overlapping projector outputs can be accomplished by using a camera to measure the keystone distortions in projected test patterns and then appropriately pre-warping the projected images.  Selects various pattern display options Pattern Display: lets you display the selected pattern type on the screen to aid in presentation.  No aim pattern seen on the new tecnical diagram no wander it confusing&nbsp; 2 May 2008 For this test your monitor must be in its native resolution.  Just keep your hands clear of the high voltage power supply since the projector probably uses a metal halide lamp.  A projector-camera pair works as a stereo system, with the advantage that a properly chosen projected pattern simpliﬁes the task of ﬁnding point correspondences.  This ensures a geometricaly correct mapping, which is mandatory for smooth movements and correct image display.  • Control multiple projectors • Obtain a projector’s status report • Diagnose performance problems Refer to the User Manual provided with the projector for all cable requirements and other connection details.

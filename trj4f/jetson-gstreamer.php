A segmentation fault sometimes occurs when the function cvCreateFileCapture is invoked on network URL.  The main GStreamer site has Reference Manual, FAQ, Applications Development Manual and Plugin Writer&#39;s Guide.  Since the camera in this example is streaming MJPG, we have to use pad jpegdec before device=/dev/video0 and then start adding other elements in the pipeline.

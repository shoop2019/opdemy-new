To transfer the analyte to free atoms, different types of atomizer are in use, the flame and the graphite furnace types being the most often used.  The use of Hydride techniques can improve the performance for hydride forming elements such as As and Se.  Atomic absorption spectrometry is a technique for determining the concentration of an element in a sample by measuring the absorption of electromagnetic radiation by the atomic vapour of the element generated from the sample.  In case of a structured baseline, for example if molecule absorption bands or other atomic absorption lines are present, it will calculate a false value.  Although GFAAS has been employed for a wide variety of analyses, the series of physical processes chemical reactions, or mechanism, by which gaseous atoms are produced has not been completely characterized, particularly at the graphite surface.  With Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption (GFAA), the sample is introduced directly into a graphite tube, which is then heated in a programmed series of steps to remove the solvent and major matrix components and to atomize the Graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy (GFAAS) (also known as Electrothermal Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (ETAAS)) is a type of spectrometry that uses a graphite-coated furnace to vaporize the sample. 13,17 However, complex liquids and solids implies the need of preparation steps, increasing the possibilities of lose or change the original form of the nanoparticles.

For detailed graphite furnace and Zeeman theory, refer to &#39;Analytical Methods for Graphite Furnace Atomizers&#39; (Publication number 8510084800).  Atomic absorption spectrometry is based on the absorption of radiation from an external excitation source by ground state atomic vapor.  In an AC Zeeman correction system, a stationary polarizer is present in front of the source, and an electromagnet is present around the furnace.  The basic idea is to form within part of an atomizer a large surface over which the collection of fine particles of the sample is to be distributed, and to constrain the vapor exit from that part to the analytical zone.  From these lists it can be seen that Atomic Absorption can measure the legal limits for toxic metals such as As, Cd, Pb and Hg in most sample types.

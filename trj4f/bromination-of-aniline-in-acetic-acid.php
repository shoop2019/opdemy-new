Direct nitration of phenol (hydroxybenzene) by dilute nitric acid gives modest yields of nitrated phenols and considerable oxidative decomposition to tarry materials; aniline (aminobenzene) is largely destroyed.  Schotten Baumann reaction mechanism regarding phenol by using acetyl chloride and acetic anhydride reagents.  The solution is magnetically stirred and cooled to room temperature to produce a finely divided suspension of the phenol, to which a solution of 32 g.  It is a colorless liquid that smells strongly of acetic acid , which is formed by its reaction with the moisture in the air.  Since the amino group of aniline is a strong activator of aromatic ring, direct bromination is impractical (equation 1).  Also the acetate pulled a proton from H3O+ to form acetid acid, while the H3O+ was going back to be H2O.  Bromination of aniline provides a good example to study orientation of the incoming electrophile on a strongly&nbsp; (i) Take 5 mL of aniline in a 100 mL round bottom flask and add acetylating mixture containing 5 mL acetic anhydride and 5 mL glacial acetic acid.

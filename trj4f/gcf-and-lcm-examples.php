Aug 01, 2020 · Greatest common Factor (GCF) This is found by finding the products of product of the intersection set of prime factors of the numbers.  For example, GCF of 2 and 8 Example: The GCF of 4 and 10 is 2, because 2 can both divide 4 and 10 with out a remainder.  For example: 3 and 8 3 = 3 8 = 2 2 2 Even though 3 and 8 has no common factor, their GCF is equal to 1.  An another Math worksheets: Find the least common multiple (LCM) of 3 numbers (2-30) Below are six versions of our grade 6 math worksheet on finding the least common multiple of 3 numbers; all numbers are less than 30.

In this article you will learn how to calculate the Greatest Common Factor (GCF) and Least Common Multiple (LCM) of integers.  Certainly 12 × 9 = 108 is a multiple of them both but we want the least common multiple so is there a multiple which is less than 108? Again look at the prime factorizations.  So, for example, in the case of 2 and 18, the least common multiple is 18 because that is the lowest valued number that both 2 and 18 share.

Office 1 is located in Boston (using local mode) Office 2 is located in Seattle (using flex connect) Local Mode means that a tunnel is created from Wireless AP to the WLC.  One environment that I found particularly challenging was getting Central Web Authentication working with FlexConnect and locally switched WLANs.  Per user QoS In my deployment all APs are in FlexConnect mode and LocalSwitching option is also enabled.  When you use FlexConnect mode you should configure the switchports where your APs connect as trunks instead of access ports like you do when you use Local mode on the AP.  VPN connections to the headquarters have gone down, but each branch site has a local authentication server.  After some mail contact with TAC this problem was being passed on to the escalation guys for the wireless business.  If you are using local AP&#39;s (not FlexConnect mode): To the right of the ACL you just created, hover the blue arrow and click Add-Remove URL.  For my proof of concept, this would prove especially useful in cases where I wanted clients at a remote location to receive a local IP to that site Do we have flexconnect feature which is used for remote site AP&#39;s to be connected to central office controller ? I have not come across so far like this feature in Aruba which has set-up in Flexconnect like central switching- Central authentication , local auth- local switching , central auth-local switching something like this.

FlexConnect Group: Local Backup Authentication ‚Ä¢Normal authentication is done centrally ‚Ä¢On WAN failure, AP authenticates new clients with its local database ‚Ä¢Each FlexConnect AP has a copy of the local user DB ‚Ä¢Existing authenticated clients stay connected ‚Ä¢Clients can roam with: CCKM fast roaming, or Local re-authentication Sep 01, 2016 ¬∑ On your WLC, make sure that your SSID has the box for Flexconnect local switching checked and AAA override checked on the advanced tab.  A RADIUS authentication server, such as CiscoSecure ACS or ISE, handles this task of assigning users to a specific VLAN.  Also, the remote site will support FlexConnect for one SSID which means traffic will not be transported back to controller for that SSID but it will be locally switched.  We will configure wireless AP and SSID to operate in central switching and local switching and compare authorization capability on ISE between the two modes.  The OP clearly states that there is no desire to use a WLC therefore FlexConnect is out of the question. 0ÁâàÊú¨‰∏≠ÔºåÂç≥‰ΩøFlexConnect APÂ§Ñ‰∫éËøûÊé•Ê®°ÂºèÔºàConnectedÔºâÔºå‰πüÊîØÊåÅÊ≠§ÂäüËÉΩ„ÄÇ May 01, 2014 ¬∑ The FlexConnect ACL is applied to the FlexConnect Group under the Policies tab later.  This feature is helpful if you have multiple FlexConnect access points in a remote office or on the floor of a building and you want to configure them all at once.  A remote authenticated user on the local network can exploit a flaw in Central Web Authentication (CWA) on FlexConnect Access Points to bypass client FlexConnect access control list (ACL) restrictions.  Flex + central auth would have the same SAE authentication between client &amp; AP, Association request is forwarded to a WLC and the response is forwarded back to the AP, and the 4-way handshake occurs between client and WLC.  Old names for FlexConnect engineer notices that Cisco CKM is not working for the FlexConnect APs when looking at roaming, but is working for local mode APs.  Which three features on the wireless A vulnerability in Central Web Authentication (CWA) with FlexConnect Access Points (APs) for Cisco Aironet 1560, 1810, 1810w, 1815, 1830, 1850, 2800, and 3800 Series APs could allow an authenticated, adjacent attacker to bypass a configured FlexConnect access control list (ACL).  FlexConnect also known previously as H-REAP ‚Äì ‚ÄúHybrid Remote Edge Access Point‚Äù is usually set-up for branch sites which are connected via a WAN link, FlexConnect access points have the ability to perform local switching and authentication, which means they can make layer 2 forwarding decisions without having to send them up to the WLC‚Ä¶ In my deployment all APs are in FlexConnect mode and LocalSwitching option is also enabled.  For which scenario is Fast Roaming supported, providing the WLAN is mapped to the same VLAN and the client is roaming to an AP on the same Cisco WLC?

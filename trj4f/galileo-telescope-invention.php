Previous telescopes increased objects three times the original size, but Galilei learned to focus the lenses and created a telescope with a 30x magnification.  His little telescope was poorer than even a cheap modern amateur telescope, but what he observed in the heavens rocked the very foundations of Aristotle&#39;s universe and the theological Galileo invented the pendulum clock, the thermoscope, the escapement, the military compass, the barometer, the thermometer and a device to draw water out of an aquifer using horse power.

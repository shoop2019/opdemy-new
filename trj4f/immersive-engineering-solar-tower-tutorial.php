Explore and implement designs that you wouldn’t otherwise consider – without having to write C, C++, or HDL code.  TIM models a concentrating tower (receiver), heliostat field, and potential reflected glare based on user-specified parameters such as field capacity, tower height and location.  Here is a solar tracker system that tracks the sun’s movement across the sky and tries to maintain the solar panel perpendicular to the sun’s rays, ensuring that the maximum amount of sunlight is incident on the panel throughout the day.  After importing the building form into Ecotect Analysis, tests reveal that the buildings to the west cast shadows across the western face of the tower, while the southern face, particularly near the top, is largely unobstructed.  RATING OF SOLAR PANEL : The solar panel size should be selected in such a way that it will charge the battery fully during the one day time.

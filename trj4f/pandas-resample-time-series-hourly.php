You can group by some time frequency such as days, weeks, business quarters, etc, and then apply an aggregate function to the groups.  In it&#39;s simplest form, a linear interpolation would just require the time series to be shifted back one step (using the shift(-1)) and take the pandas resampled mean of the Pandas provides methods for resampling time series data.  Accordingly, weâve copied many of features that make working with time-series data in pandas such a joy to xarray. The traditional name Vega (earlier Wega) comes from a loose transliteration of the Arabic word wÄqiâ meaning &quot;falling&quot; or &quot;landing&quot;, via the phrase an-nasr al-wÄqiâ, &quot;the falling eagle&quot;.
